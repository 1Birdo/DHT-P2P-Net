# DHT-P2P-Net

## Project Overview

*This project has potential. While I'm not deeply experienced with P2P, the core concepts seem manageable, and my focus is on laying down the fundamental logic and structure. It may not reach full completion, but the groundwork should be solid.

Feel free to build upon or repurpose this project if you'd like.*

Due to its decentralized nature, the repository will contain minimal files â€” as each instance acts as both the client and the server.

Unexpected Botnet P2P Request via Email

Out of the blue, I received a strange `.MD` file in my inbox containing a detailed technical specification for a peer-to-peer botnet architecture. The sender claimed it was a paid request, offering between **$30,000â€“$100,000** for the full source code. ðŸ˜•

This repository was created to **expose** this kind of suspicious behavior and to **experiment with an open-source version** of what was described â€” mostly for research and transparency. After exchanging a few emails to clarify their requirements, the sender eventually went silent.

I'm not here to throw accusations, but the whole situation felt *off* and raised some flags.

DHT / Packet Flow Summary:

[Bot A] â€”FIND_NODEâ€”> [Bot B]  
[Bot B] â€”NODESâ€”> [Bot A]  
[Bot A] â€”FIND_VALUEâ€”> [Bot C]  
[Bot C] â€”VALUE (Command)â€”> [Bot A]

# P2P Botnet Technical Specification Document

> **Note**: This system is a decentralized botnet. Its core functions include command distribution, attack execution, node concealment and persistence, replay protection, and signature authentication. The network layer uses libp2p + Kademlia DHT to implement a control system that requires no central server.

---

## 1. Networking Layer

### 1.1 Architecture Design

- Implement peer-to-peer communication using [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p)
- Use Kademlia DHT as the medium for information distribution and lookup
- Each Bot node independently generates a PeerID and joins the DHT network

### 1.2 Bootstrapping

- On startup, connect to multiple built-in bootstrap nodes
- Address format supported: `/ip4/<IP>/tcp/<PORT>/p2p/<PeerID>`

### 1.3 Node Identity

- Generate/load libp2p RSA key pair
- Persist locally (default file: `peerkey`)

### 1.4 NAT Traversal

- Use libp2p NATPortMap to support UPnP/PCP port forwarding

---

## 2. Command & Control via DHT

### 2.1 Command Format

```json
{
  "command": "!udpflood 1.2.3.4 80 60",
  "timestamp": 1719412112,
  "signature": "<signature_data>",
  "ttl": 120
}
```

- `command`: Plaintext command string
- `timestamp`: Unix timestamp to prevent replay attacks
- `signature`: RSA PKCS1v15 signature
- `ttl`: Command validity period (in seconds)

### 2.2 Data Distribution

- Controller writes command to DHT via `PutValue("latest_attack_command", data)`
- Bot fetches command every 10 seconds using `GetValue`
- Validates using signature + time window check

### 2.3 Status Reporting

- Each bot reports JSON data via DHT key: `bot_stats_<PeerID>`
- Includes: uptime, last command time, total attack count, etc.

---

## 3. Security Mechanisms

### 3.1 Command Signature Verification

- Controller holds the unique RSA private key; Bot embeds the matching public key
- Validation process:
  1. Controller: Sign(SHA256(command + "|" + timestamp))
  2. Bot: rsa.VerifyPKCS1v15 + timestamp check + replay prevention

### 3.2 Anti-Debugging

- Checks `/proc/self/status` for TracerPid != 0 to detect debugger
- If debugging detected, bot exits immediately

### 3.3 Analysis Tool Defense

- Attempts to terminate known analysis tools such as `gdb`, `tcpdump`, `strace`, `ltrace`, `wireshark`
- Uses shell command: `pkill -9 <tool>`

### 3.4 Replay Protection

- Caches hash of each command to detect replays
- Performs cleanup every hour, retaining commands within the last 10 minutes

---

## 4. Other Modules (Brief Overview)

- **Command Execution**: Supports UDP/TCP/HTTP Flood
- **Persistence**: Installs as systemd service, auto-starts on boot
- **Logging**: Colored terminal output, supports debug tracing

---

## 5. Controller Suggestions

- Command signer: Generates signed commands using RSA private key
- Data viewer: Fetches and parses bot\_stats from DHT
- Automated delivery: Supports multi-node broadcast
- Optional: GUI / Web UI for management
